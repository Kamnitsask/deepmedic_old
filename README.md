Efficient Multi-Scale 3D Convolutional Neural Network for Brain Lesion Segmentation

### News

The DeepMedic project aims at providing an easy to use tool and robust tool for segmentation of medical images with deep learning.

**We continue our efforts to maintain and extend this project.**

To better manage our efforts and workload, the repo was transferred seamlessly under its own organization.

**The repository has been transferred to:**

https://github.com/deepmedic

Please find our work and follow the new developments there. Thank you all for your interest in our work and the continuous feedback. **Keep the feedback going, it's what keeps us going :-)**


Sincerely,
Konstantinos Kamnitsas
